Bug: Invalid commands counted as processes and increments the max number of processes allowed.
Fixer: Joe
Time Spent: 30 mins 
Solution: Decrement number of active processes when invalid command is entered (so net is 0).
------------
Bug: Background processes also write to video memory.
Fixer: Cody
Time Spent: 1 hr
Solution: Fixed the background pages for processes so that only one writes to physical vid mem at a time.
------------
Bug: Fix video mapping problems; add ability to set screen and cursor positions for not active terminals

Bug: Switching terminal when the max num of processes are already running causes an error.
Fixer: Cody
Time Spent: 40 mins
Solution: Don't allow terminal switch when the max processes running.
------------
Bug: Too long of a command name breaks program and causes a page fault.
Fixer: Mahir
Time Spent: 20 mins
Solution: Buffer size overflow is checked for when parsing command.
------------
Bug: PIT just wasn't working.
Fixer: Cody
Time Spent: 45 mins
Solution: Proper out words were added and frequency set.
------------
Bug: Page fault when switching terminals quickly.
Fixer: Ben
Time Spent: 15 mins
Solution: Put part of switch terminal code inside of a critical section.
------------
Bug: Command history not displayed correctly when up then back down to most recent commands.
Fixer: Joe
Time Spent: 30 mins
Solution: Increment the counter in the case when the command was the most recent one.

Bug: File descriptors were not properly closed.
Fixer: Ben
Time Spent: 10 mins
Solution: Set each file operation table pointers to a dummy.
------------
Bug: Fix errors noticed by syserr; allow ctrl+4 to just increase the rtc rate without printing

Bug: Typing incorrect commands (those with repeat of end char) still runs the program.
Fixer: Majir
Time Spent: 15 mins
Solution: Checked for correct command length and repeats.
------------
Bug: Unpredicatable behavior and page faulting due to an incorrect page size
Fixer: Cody
Time Spent: 5 mins
Solution: Redefined constant in hex rather than decimal.
------------
Bug: Page fault when executing new program from shell after returning to shell from prev program (2nd time running prog).
Fixer: Mayear
Time Spent: 6 hrs
Solution: Add a variable to tell paging function to overwrite previous page entries.
------------
Bug: RTC read blocked so that Ctrl+4 functionality for chkpt 3 didn't work.
Fixer: Ben
Time Spent: 2 hrs
Solution: Changed order of EOI being sent to PIC and keyboard char input processing.
------------
Bug: Program couldn't write to its virtual memory.
Fixer: Joe
Time Spent: 20 mins
Solution: Change the program virtual mem mapping from read-only to read+write.
------------
Bug: Command argument into syscall was not being interpreted correctly.
