------------
Bug: Can't initialize pa-pa-p-page page p..page for uhhhhhhhh uhm bookkeeping info for malloc.
Fixer: Joe 
Time Spent: 30 mins 
Solution: Changed end of memory to 256 megabytes instead of 4 GB.
------------
Bug: Executing programs don't always write to the visible terminal
Fixer: Cody
Time Spent: 15 hours 
Solution: Include a newline flag for each terminal so pressing enter checks that the specific terminal's enter was called
------------
Bug: Ctrl+L doesn't always return cursor pointer to top left
Fixer: Cody
Time Spent: 2 mins 
Solution: Change clear_screen() to depend on vis_term_id
------------
Bug: Invalid commands counted as processes and increments the max number of processes allowed.
Fixer: Cody
Time Spent: 30 mins 
Solution: Decrement number of active processes when invalid command is entered (so net is 0).
------------
Bug: Background processes also write to video memory.
Fixer: Cody
Time Spent: 1 hr
Solution: Fixed the background pages for processes so that only one writes to physical vid mem at a time.
------------
Bug: Fix video mapping problems; add ability to set screen and cursor positions for not active terminals
Fixer: Cody
Time Spent: 2 hours
Solution: Create separate putc functions for visible and scheduled terminals
------------
Bug: Switching terminal when the max num of processes are already running causes an error.
Fixer: Cody
Time Spent: 40 mins
Solution: Don't allow terminal switch when the max processes running.
------------
Bug: Too long of a command name breaks program and causes a page fault.
Fixer: Mahir
Time Spent: 20 mins
Solution: Buffer size overflow is checked for when parsing command.
------------
Bug: PIT just wasn't working.
Fixer: Cody
Time Spent: 45 mins
Solution: Set pit frequency to 1000hz to be able to break in terms of ms
------------
Bug: Page fault when switching terminals quickly.
Fixer: Ben
Time Spent: 15 mins
Solution: Put part of switch terminal code inside of a critical section.
------------
Bug: Command history not displayed correctly when up then back down to most recent commands.
Fixer: Joe
Time Spent: 30 mins
Solution: Increment the counter in the case when the command was the most recent one.
------------
Bug: File descriptors were not properly closed.
Fixer: Ben
Time Spent: 10 mins
Solution: Set each file operation table pointers to a dummy.
------------
Bug: Fix errors noticed by syserr
Fixer: Cody 
Time Spent: 1.5 hours
Solution: Add bounds checking on file descriptors in sys calls
------------
Bug: Typing incorrect commands (those with repeat of end char) still runs the program.
Fixer: Mahir
Time Spent: 15 mins
Solution: Checked for correct command length and repeats.
------------
Bug: Unpredicatable behavior and page faulting due to an incorrect page size
Fixer: Cody
Time Spent: 5 mins
Solution: Redefined constant in hex rather than decimal.
------------
Bug: Page fault when executing new program from shell after returning to shell from prev program (2nd time running prog).
Fixer: Mahir
Time Spent: 6 hrs
Solution: Add a variable to tell paging function to overwrite previous page entries.
------------
Bug: RTC read blocked so that Ctrl+4 functionality for chkpt 3 didn't work.
Fixer: Ben
Time Spent: 2 hrs
Solution: Changed order of EOI being sent to PIC and keyboard char input processing.
------------
Bug: Program couldn't write to its virtual memory.
Fixer: Joe
Time Spent: 20 mins
Solution: Change the program virtual mem mapping from read-only to read+write.
------------
Bug: Command argument into syscall was not being interpreted correctly.
Fixer: Cody
Time Spent: 5 mins
Solution: Jump in assembly wrapper for syscall from jle to jl.
------------
Bug: Some data blocks were not being fully read.
Fixer: Mahir
Time Spent: 45 mins
Solution: Added logic to continue reading next data block if one ends before entire length of inode was read.
------------
Bug: Backspace key when current line is blank moves up the screen to previous, supposedly set, lines.
Fixer: Cody
Time Spent: 1 hr
Solution: Keyboard buffer current index variable was reset every time enter key pressed.
------------
Bug: fixed some bugs in ctrl+2 and ctrl+3; uncertain about fsys_*
Fixer: Mahir
Time Spent:
Solution:
------------
Bug: Fix scrolling early
Fixer: Cody
Time Spent: 20 minutes
Solution: Put scroll() inside if statements in putc()
------------
Bug: Wrong bitmap being used in paging.
Fixer: Joe
Time Spent: 30 mins
Solution: Changed the bitmap from the last 12 bits to the last 22 bits.
------------
Bug: Interrupts were randomly going off causing a hemorrhage of exceptions & errors.
Fixer: Ben
Time Spent: 15 mins
Solution: Corrected PIC masks variables.
------------
Bug: Junk in page table directories causing random faults.
Fixer: Mahir
Time Spent: 10 mins
Solution: Clear page table memory region when being initialized.
